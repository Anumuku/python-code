Union of E and N
code:
  E = {0,1,2,3,4,5,8,6}
  N = {1,2,3,4,5} 
  D = E.union(N)
  print(D)

Intersection of E and N
code:
  E = {0,1,2,3,4,5,8,6}
  N = {2,4} 
  D = E.intersection(N)
  print(D)

Difference of E and N 
code:
  E = {0,1,2,3,4,5,8,6}
  N = {1,2,3,4,5}
  D = E.difference(N)
  print(D)

Symmetric Difference E and N
code:
  E = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8}
  N = {2,4}
  D=E.symmetric_difference(N)
  print(D)
